          work I've done over the years, but some of my favorites!

            alt="Four-panel artwork of a human skull, each panel painted in a different pastel color: peach, pink, yellow, and blue. The top two panels focus on the skull's eye sockets, while the bottom two panels depict the jaw and teeth. The bold black outlines and color contrasts give a modern and graphic look to the traditional skull imagery."

          <h4>Skull on Four Canvases</h4>

            Acrylic on Canvas <br />
            42" x 48" <br />
            This was a personal project to add a statement piece in my bedroom.
            It is one of my favorite pieces I have ever done.

            alt="Vibrant painting of a lion's face in shades of pink and magenta against a soft blue background. The image features a stylized depiction of the lion with intense eyes and a lush mane, creating a striking contrast with the calming background."

            Acrylic on Canvas <br />
            24" x 30" <br />
            This was a piece done for my shared room in my sorority house. Our
            sorority's symbol is a lion. This is one of my more detailed,
            realistic pieces..

            alt="A bold painting of a sun and moon intertwined, with the moon nestled in the center of the sun's rays, depicted in black against a vibrant yellow background. The facial features of both celestial bodies are stylized and expressive, conveying a sense of harmony and balance."

          <h4>Sun & Moon</h4>
          <p class="source-sans">
            Acrylic on Canvas<br />
            18" x 24" <br />
            This was another personal project to add to my bedroom, but I ended
            up not loving it. The sun and moon inspiration comes from my parents
            who have tattoos of the sun and moon as tribute to each other.

            This painting was a gift for a Grateful Dead fan. I reallly like how
            the colorful background behind the black ink turned out.
